## Study Sequence Recommendation
1. Start with **Domain 1** (foundational concepts)
2. Move to **Domain 3** (architecture principles)
3. Continue with **Domain 4** (network security)
4. Then **Domain 5** (IAM - builds on architecture)
5. **Domain 6** (assessment - ties together previous domains)
6. **Domain 7** (operations - practical application)
7. **Domain 8** (software development)
8. **Domain 2** (asset security - integrates all concepts)
